## Adding Thread Settings

This information describes your VoiceThread project as a whole, not just the one image or slide you uploaded or selected.

## Adding Comments

Adding comments is where VoiceThread's power really comes through. This is how you add a comment on someone else's VoiceThread as well.

-   Once you have your photos set, you are now ready to add
comments to your VoiceThread. On the main VoiceThread screen, click on the option. The screen will refresh with an expanded view of your VoiceThread.

![Adding comments option.](media/reference-voicethread/image14.png)
\ 

-   When you are viewing the VoiceThread, you may view existing comments by clicking on the avatar or image of the person who has already left a comment. You may also press the button, which will move through all existing comments in order.

-   To leave a comment, click on the button just above the bottom of the screen.

![Comment button.](media/reference-voicethread/image16.png)
\ 

-   You will be offered a number of different options, such as adding a text comment, comment by phone, recorded audio comment, video comment, or uploading a file. Adding a comment by phone may cost you money, so this is not recommended. Most comments you are expected to contribute have nothing to do with separate files, so instructions for uploading a file are not included here.

### Text Comments

-   To add a text comment, click on the text comment option (it is represented by ABC). You will then be presented with a text pop-up box. Type in the box and then click on the button when you are ready. Your comment then gets added to the end of the timeline.

\ 

-   You will see a countdown screen, which is your cue as to when recording will start. Once it counts down, you can talk and your computer's microphone will record you. When you are ready, click on the Stop button at the bottom of the screen. VoiceThread will play the recording back to you, and if you are satisfied, click on the Save button and your voice comment will be added to the end of the timeline. If you are not satisfied, click the button and you can re-record your comment.

### Video Comments

-   To add a recorded video comment, click on the video comment option (it is represented by a video camera ). The first time you click on this option, you may be asked to approve VoiceThread's use of your computer's camera, much like recording an audio comment. Click the button.

-   Just like with audio recording, you will see a countdown screen, which is your cue as to when recording will start. Once it counts down, you can talk and your computer's camera will record you. When you are ready, click on the Stop button at the bottom of the screen. VoiceThread will play the video back to you, and if you are satisfied, click on the Save button and your voice comment will be added to the end of the timeline. If you are not satisfied, click the button and you can re-record your comment.

### Finish Commenting

-   When you are done, click on the close button in the shape of an X to return to your VoiceThread. You are now ready to share. Go ahead and click on the button.

## Sharing and Submitting Your VoiceThread

You can share your VoiceThreads in two ways. In order to submit your VoiceThread to Canvas, you need to follow the instructions for both ways.

### Sharing from the Thread Editing Screen
-   While working on your thread, click on the \[Share and Return to Course\] button at the top of the screen.

![Share button.](media/reference-voicethread/image20.png)
\ 

-   First, make sure that the "View and comment" option is selected under "Others will be able to:" so that your instructor (and other students) will be able to access and comment on your VoiceThread. Then click on the \[Submit/share with \{Course Name/Number\}\] button. You will then be returned to the VoiceThread Dashboard for the course.

**And that's it!**
