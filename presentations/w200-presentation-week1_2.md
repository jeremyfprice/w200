# What Is Meant By 'Good' and 'Just'?

## What Is Meant By 'Good' and 'Just'?

  * How do you define 'Good' and 'Just'?
  * How are the terms similar?
  * How are the terms different?
  * What do 'Good' and 'Just' look like in the classroom?
  * What roles could technology play?

# What the 'Experts' Say about Good and Just Teaching

## Focusing on the Good

  * Start your focus on 'students in the margins'
  * The 'what' and 'how' of teaching is held to rigorous standards
  * Teachers have high expectations of all students
  * Teachers engage students in opportunities for critical questioning

(Cochran-Smith et al., 2009; Grant, 2012; Rose & Meyer, 2000)

## Focusing on the Just

  * Recognition that there are disparities in educational opportunities, resources and achievement between marginalized students and their wealthier white counterparts
  * Engage in a critique of the universalist views of knowledge which do not adequately recognize the experiences and knowledge of marginalized groups
  * Provide curriculum and content that is both challenging and culturally sustaining
  * Practice democracy and engage in social activism in the classroom

(Cochran Smith et al., 2009; Grant, 2012)

## Focusing on the People at the Intersection

  * Look deeply into you, who you are, what you value, what role you see yourself playing in the larger society and how your own traditions and experiences have influenced you
  * Be a 'friend of their minds' ('Make yourself a teacher, find yourself a friend,' *Pirke Avot* 1:6)
  * Find and surround yourself with others who will learn and grow with you and support you along your journey

(Grant, 2012)
