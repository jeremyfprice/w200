  * What were some of the strengths of using this tool? Where did this tool fall short?
  * What did you learn about analyzing online materials?

# Jigsaw Part 1B

# How Can We Be Certain Of Anything These Days?

"Knowledge consists in the search for truth.... Since we can never know anything for sure, it is simply not worth searching for certainty; but it is well worth searching for truth...." *-Karl Popper*

# Why Is This Process Important?

Evil '...possesses neither depth nor any demonic dimension. It can overgrow and lay waste the whole world precisely because it spreads like a fungus on the surface. It is "thought-defying"... because thought tries to reach some depth, to go the roots.... Only the good has depth and can be radical.' *-Hannah Arendt*
