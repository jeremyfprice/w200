# Critical Reading

  * Is it a credible source?
  * What is the point of view?
  * Does it align with other sources and with reality?
  * Who benefits?

# Other Considerations About Truth

Real or fake, we love to see and consume information that aligns with who we are as a person and what we already think and believe. We think, oh, I'm not going to get fooled, but we're all susceptible...

When I read something that makes me feel good, I try to question why that is. **And I think that level of emotional skepticism of your own emotions is maybe the next level for people to try to get to.**

"There is beauty in art, in literature, in science, and in every triumph of intelligence, all of which I covet for my country. But there is a higher beauty stillâ€”in relieving the poor, in elevating the downtrodden, and being a succor to the oppressed. There is true grandeur in an example of justice, making the rights of all the same as our own, and beating down prejudice, like Satan, under our feet. Humbly do I pray that the republic may not lose this great prize, or postpone its enjoyment." - Charles Sumner, 1871
