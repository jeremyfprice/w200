# How Do We Approach Truth In Our Teaching With Technology Part II {data-background="media/week5/title2.png"}

# Warm-Up {data-background="media/week5/crowd.png"}

# Recap...

"One thing that's been interesting... to watch is that people that say facts are facts — they're not really facts. Everybody has a way — it's kind of like looking at ratings or looking at a glass of half-full water. Everybody has a way of interpreting them to be the truth or not true. There's no such thing, unfortunately anymore, of facts."

\- Scottie Nell Hughes

# How Can We Be Certain Of Anything These Days?

"Knowledge consists in the search for truth.... Since we can never know anything for sure, it is simply not worth searching for certainty; but it is well worth searching for truth...." *-Karl Popper*

# Critical Reading

  * Is it a credible source?
  * What is the point of view?
  * Does it align with other sources and with reality?
  * Who benefits?

# Other Considerations About Truth

Real or fake, we love to see and consume information that aligns with who we are as a person and what we already think and believe. We think, oh, I'm not going to get fooled, but we're all susceptible...

When I read something that makes me feel good, I try to question why that is. And I think that level of emotional skepticism of your own emotions is maybe the next level for people to try to get to.
