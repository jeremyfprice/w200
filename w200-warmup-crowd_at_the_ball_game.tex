\poemtitle{The Crowd at the Ball Game}

\begin{verse}%[\versewidth]
The crowd at the ball game\\
is moved uniformly\\
by a spirit of uselessness\\
which delights them\textemdash\\
all the exciting detail\\
of the chase\\
and the escape, the error\\
the flash of genius\textemdash\\
all to no end save beauty\\
the eternal\textemdash\\
So in detail they, the crowd,\\
are beautiful\\
for this\\
to be warned against\\
saluted and defied\textemdash\\
It is alive, venomous\\
it smiles grimly\\
its words cut\textemdash\\
The flashy female with her\\
mother, gets it\textemdash\\
The Jew gets it straight\textemdash it\\
is deadly, terrifying\textemdash\\
It is the Inquisition, the\\
Revolution\\
It is beauty itself\\
that lives\\
day by day in them\\
idly\textemdash\\
This is\\
the power of their faces\\
It is summer, it is the solstice\\
the crowd is\\
cheering, the crowd is laughing\\
in detail\\
permanently, seriously\\
without thought\\
\end{verse}
