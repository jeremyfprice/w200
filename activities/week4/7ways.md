# 7 ways to spot and debunk fake news

Source: http://www.newsday.com/opinion/7-ways-to-spot-and-debunk-fake-news-1.12695382

  1. Stop! How do you know it is true? What's the evidence?
  *Remember, the more outrageous the story, the higher the bar should be before you trust or share anything on social media.*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

  2. Check whether the story actually supports the headline, and beware of headlines all in capital letters.
  
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

  3. Always ask, “Says who?” We tell children not to take candy from strangers. Well, don’t take information from strangers. Who is responsible for the story? Is it a known journalist or news outlet? If not, how many friends, followers does the source have? What have they posted in the past?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

  4. If you follow a link to a website, do all the links seen there work? What does the “About Us” page say? When was the information updated?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

  5. Check whether fact-checking websites such as Snopes.com or FactCheck.org have investigated the information, or just type the claim into a Google search and add the word “hoax.”

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

  6. Cut and paste images into reverse search engines like TinEye.com. Startling images often are not fake, but rather have appeared before in a different context.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

  7. Beware of stories that come from people you trust — even from your friends and relatives. Don’t confuse the sender with the source of the information.
