# The CRAP Test

Source: http://www.workliteracy.com/pages/the-crap-test/

##Currency

How recent is the information? How recently has the website been updated? Is it current enough for your topic?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

##Reliability
What kind of information is included in the resource? Is content of the resource primarily opinion? Is is balanced? Does the creator provide references or sources for data or quotations?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

##Authority
Who is the creator or author? What are their credentials? Who is the publisher or sponsor? Are they reputable? What is the publisher's interest (if any) in this information? Are there advertisements on the website?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

##Purpose/Point of View

Is this fact or opinion? Is it biased? Is the creator/author trying to sell you something?
